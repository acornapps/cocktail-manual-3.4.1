        "excerpt":" 层积云是一种 容器一体化管理平台(All-in-one Container Management Platform)。   随着云服务的普遍使用，除了基础架构，对应用程序、服务管理的要求也越来越高。像过去的 开发和运营方式充分发挥云的优势是有限的。尤其是应用程序领域，持续整合以及部署 (Continuous Integration/Deploy，CI/CD)、迁移(Migration)、多云/混合云的构筑等自动化、高 效化、整合管理的需求日益增加。   可以说容器技术的扩散是理所当然。目前很多企业已经引进了容器技术，呈现继续增强趋势。 (参考: http://redmonk.com/fryan/2017/09/10/cloud-native-technologies-in-the-fortune-100)   容器是将应用程序或服务压缩成可独立运行单位的技术，无论基础架构环境如何，都可以提供 相同的开发和运营经验。可以实现从基础架构到服务的云管理体系标准化，也可以减少开发及 运营工作量。尤其是不变的环境下，能管理好多云/混合云是它的优点所在。   层积云将容器优点适用于云管理服务，实现了开发及运营业务的高效化，为单一或多云/混合云 战略实施提供了平台。   层积云的主要职能如下      从代码到 Build、部署、更新环节的渠道自动化;   工作负载(服务)中心的容器管理:压缩、生命周期、资源等;   全栈监控:从基础架构到容器的状态以及资源的监控、报警管理;   多云/混合云集群配置及管理:Baremetal、私人/公共云。     下文 : 层积云组件概要  ","categories": [],
