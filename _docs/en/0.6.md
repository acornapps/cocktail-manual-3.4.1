The dashboard layer provides service status, monitoring, and cluster status information via a web-based UI.

The dashboard provides role-specific views according to user privileges. Cocktail user privileges are as follows:

* Administrator : The admin manages clusters and has administrative privileges on all Cocktail services.

* DevOps : A DevOps user has administrative privileges only for assigned services. The dashboard provides views only for authorized services and is restricted from cluster management, environment settings, and other management features.

* Manager : A manager can access all views and information but cannot perform management actions such as creation or modification. This user privilege is granted to users who perform analyses \(e.g., status\).

Cocktail provides the following dashboard views:

* Comprehensive dashboard : A comprehensive status view of all services and clusters.

* Service management view :  DevOps user view for creating, deploying, and monitoring services.

* Catalog view :  View for looking up service and platform catalogs and deployment.

* Cluster view :  View for integrated-managing and monitoring multiple clusters.

* Environment settings :  Settings view for the Cocktail platform.
